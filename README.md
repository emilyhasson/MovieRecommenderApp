# Movie Recommender App

The app should be available here: https://emilyhasson-movierecommenderapp-app-xqqlci.streamlit.app

But if it is not, you can run it locally:
1. pip install `requirements.txt` in your environment
2. navigate to the directory in terminal and run `streamlit run app.py `
3. The app should open in your browser.

Tested in Safari.
